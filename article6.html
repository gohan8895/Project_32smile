            <b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br>
            Caring for our pediatric patients is always a great pleasure. In my opinion, it is so great a pleasure that
            I have chosen to spend my entire career taking care of children. It is my passion! As dentists, we strive to
            provide complete patient experiences, seamless skills, and flawless results, all in the constant pursuit of
            perfection. We are not satisfied until we reach that excellence. While this is the same when we have
            children as patients, we are often pushed beyond the challenges of the tooth. Our concerns are the same as
            with adult patients: depth of decay, pulpal health, structural integrity of restorations, and all else that
            goes into excellent form and healthy function of the dentition. However, we are also presented with behavior
            management concerns. Young children have varying degrees of developmental stages according to their ages
            and, along with this, different and sometimes impulsive or unpredictable degrees of cooperation and
            tolerance for dental treatment. Given that, we must work even more efficiently and effectively when treating
            children. We must rely even more on excellent technique and outstanding materials. Any steps that will
            increase the chances of clinical success of a procedure on the first attempt should be taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Most Common Restorative Material Being Used in Pediatric Dentistry</b> <br>
            Although dental caries is a preventable disease, much of our time and resources in our offices are spent on
            dental restorations. The most common restorative material used in North America is composite resin. The NIH
            has estimated that more than 122 million composite resin restorations are placed in North American dental
            offices annually. In pediatric dentistry, a 2016 study assessed what types of direct restorative materials
            were used in posterior teeth by American and Canadian pediatric dentists. Results revealed that composite
            resin is the restorative material of choice for American and Canadian dentists when placing Class I, II, and
            V restorations in primary and permanent teeth in both healthy and medically compromised individuals.1
            However, composite resin restorative material is highly technique sensitive, and care must be taken during
            placement. The material, as we know, is extremely hydrophobic and involves multiple steps for placement and
            accurate light curing. Although the longevity of composite resin restorations in primary dentition is higher
            than other tooth-colored intracoronal restorations (ie, glass ionomers) in a retrospective study of primary
            teeth, the annual failure rates for composites were found to be 9.5% for up to 4 years of followup.2 Another
            study showed a very wide variation in annual failure rate of composite resin restorations of between zero
            percent and 29.9%. This study showed that operator experience, size of the restoration, and the location or
            position of the tooth will affect the longevity of a restoration. A restoration that includes more than 3
            surfaces is more susceptible to failure when restored with composite resin.3 The main reason for the failure
            of restorations is secondary caries. Secondary caries can commonly occur at margins of restorations and
            tooth structures and can be present for multiple reasons, including moisture contamination, incomplete light
            curing, voids of material, or and shrinkage of restorative materials. The ability to work in a
            moisture-controlled environment with reliable and efficient materials will certainly result in a higher
            success rate.4 Additionally, as new materials are developed, these results, and the annual failure rates and
            longevity of composite resin restorations in general, must be re-examined.5
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Increased Efficiency With Recently Introduced, Innovative Products</b> <br>
            Tokuyama Dental America has introduced unique dental materials with efficiency and efficacy that allow for
            faster, more reliable treatments. Tokuyama Universal Bond (Tokuyama Dental America) is a unique self-cure
            universal adhesive with high bond strengths. It bonds to all dental substrates—for example, enamel, dentin,
            composites, zirconia, and metals. Placement involves only 3 simple steps: dispense and mix, apply, and air
            dry. There is no need to agitate, wait, or light cure before placement of the restorative material of
            choice. Eliminating the light-curing step shortens the procedure; eliminates errors from improper
            light-curing techniques, equipment, or operators; and also decreases the possibility of error in
            difficult-to-access areas, which curing lights may not be able to reach. The consequences of improper light
            curing are many, such as inflammatory response of the tooth; lower bond strengths; water sorption;
            microleakage; sensitivity; and, of course, recurrent decay.6 Tokuyama Universal Bond is compatible with all
            etching techniques: self-etch, total-etch, and selective-etch. Additionally, Tokuyama Universal Bond has a
            fluoride-release component. All of these features combined make it an excellent choice for pediatric
            patients.
            <br>
            OMNICHROMA (Tokuyama Dental America) is a unique and cutting-edge resin composite material available as a
            single shade that literally blends seamlessly into the shade of the tooth being restored. “Omni-“ means
            “all” or “universally,” and “chroma” is “a quality of color combining hue and saturation” (Merriam-Webster
            Dictionary). So OMNICHROMA means “all colors,” as it is a single-shade resin composite that blends
            flawlessly and takes on the shade of surrounding tooth structure, whether it is anywhere from A1 to D4,
            making the restoration invisible. The uniform-sized, 260-nm, supra-nano, spherical SiO2-ZrO2 fillers produce
            the effect to create structural color to match the surrounding tooth structure. There is no need to shade
            match any longer, and even better, as a result, there is no longer any need to stock multiple shades
            in-office. OMNICHROMA is highly filled at 79% by weight, with low polymerization shrinkage and good
            radiopacity. It is BPA- and bis-GMA-free. Recently, concern over BPA and its derivatives’ estrogenic
            properties have led to the desire of some patients and dentists to not use materials that contain BPA. BPA
            can be found in a patient’s saliva up to 3 hours after placement of a composite resin restoration.7 With
            this composite, there are no BPA concerns. It can be placed in increments of 2 mm and light cured. There are
            many advantages to bulk filling whenever possible. Layering composite is, first and foremost,
            time-consuming. Incremental layers increase the likelihood of voids between increments and the chances of
            cohesive failure. Furthermore, incremental layering has been questioned and has not been shown conclusively
            to definitively help reduce the effects of shrinkage stress compared to bulk placement.8 Finally, this
            material polishes easily and effortlessly, making it a fast and easy composite resin material to place and
            finish. It is also appropriate for use in pediatric dentistry.

          <p>
            <b>CASE REPORT</b> <br>
            A 4-year-old patient presented with multiple caries. For the purpose of this case study, the focus will be
            upon the distal carious lesion (Tooth J). The quadrant is isolated using a ligated 2A Ivory rubber dam clamp
            and Hedy rubber dam. Preparation was done using a No. 556 cross-cut carbide bur, ensuring that adequate
            preparation would allow for a sufficient bulk of material. Cavity design and preparation should be as
            conservative as possible while, at the same time, allowing for sufficient depth of preparation to be able to
            have enough bulk of material at a suitable thickness for strength in order to resist the possibility of
            fracture. The strength of our restorative material, OMNICHROMA, in this case was excellent. Caution must be
            taken at the same time to ensure an adequate bulk of material to leave enough remaining tooth structure to
            maintain the integrity of the tooth. Attention must be paid so as to not undermine any cusps while removing
            any infected dentin. Care must also be taken to include mechanical retention into the preparation (Figure
            1). As many children brux, mechanical retention is necessary since the occlusal portion of the tooth may be
            worn over time, and relying upon adhesive alone may lead to premature failure of the restoration.
            <br>
            The matrix system chosen for this case was the Triodent V3 Ring (Ultradent Products) and sectional matrices
            (Figure 1). The placement of sectional matrices is of utmost importance for the integrity of gingival
            margins. Interproximal contacts are certainly improved when sectional matrices are used. But in primary or
            mixed dentition, the contacts are less of a concern as the movement and position of teeth are much more
            fluid than in permanent dentition. Over a short period of time, loose contacts in primary dentition become
            tighter with the eruption of new teeth. Thus, the rationale for sectional matrix use in primary dentition is
            more for the adaptation of the matrix to the margins, allowing for less microleakage and greater longevity
            of the restoration. Anecdotally, I can attest that those composite restorations that I place using sectional
            matrices and rings most definitely have better longevity. Tokuyama Universal Bond is a self-etch adhesive. A
            selective-etch technique with 35% phosphoric acid was used in this case and is preferable whenever possible
            (Figure 2). It has been cited that a selective-etch technique of applying phosphoric acid etch to enamel by
            only using universal-type bonding agents enhances bond strength.9,10 Tokuyama Universal Bond is a 2-bottle
            self-cure system. One drop from each of the bottles Bond A and Bond B is mixed in a well and applied over
            all surfaces to be bonded. Care must be taken to ensure that bond is placed on all surfaces of both enamel
            and dentin, including those hard-to-reach areas: for example, the gingival box. In cases of primary
            dentition, a very small microbrush must be chosen in order to reach these areas (Figures 3 and 4). Once all
            surfaces are coated, a weak stream of air (5 seconds), followed by a medium stream of air (5 seconds), is
            directed at the tooth to evaporate the solvent. No light curing is required as Tokuyama Universal Bond is a
            self-cure adhesive. Direct restoration follows. In this case, OMNICHROMA was placed (Figure 5). Proper
            shaping of the composite prior to light curing minimizes any polishing required (Figure 6). The Triodent V3
            Ring was removed, contacts were checked, and interproximal areas were cleaned with dental floss (Figure 7).
            The restoration was photographed at a routine followup at one-month postoperatively (Figure 8).

            <b>CLOSING COMMENTS</b> <br>
            The placement of intracoronal composite restorations for children is one of the most common dental
            procedures in North American family practices. It is important to be able to place these restorations as
            effectively and efficiently as possible. We strive to provide the best for our patients. With advances in
            dental material technology, as found in Tokuyama Universal Bond and OMNICHROMA, we now have even more tools
            in our armamentarium to create and provide functional, aesthetic, and long-lasting restorations for our
            children.
