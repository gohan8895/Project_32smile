                      Implant dentistry is a specialised field for the replacement of missing teeth. This is done with
                      titanium fixtures placed in the jawbone. These fixtures are used to support missing teeth.
                      Dentists will place the titanium fixtures and some time is necessary for the bone to heal
                      completely around these fixtures, after which crowns can be placed via intermediate abutments.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      At 32 SMILES, computer-aided dental implant treatment is employed. The recent development of
                      our digital workspace has fully integrated various technologies (that improve the predictability
                      and safety of implant treatment) to provide a one-stop facility for performing Computer-Aided
                      Implant Treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Our specialists have collaborated with various institutions and private clinics to teach and
                      further enhance the standards of predictability and safety of implant treatment. The use of
                      specialised computer software and digital 3-dimensional x-ray facility has allowed our dentists to
                      plan and perform implant surgeries in a virtual space. This serves to prepare our dentists during
                      the performance of the actual surgery and hence improves the safety and predictability of implant
                      treatment. Specialised laboratory equipment and trained technicians are available on-site to
                      ensure a precise fit and the quality of your new teeth.

                      CROWN are needed when the tooth is badly damaged either by trauma or decay. Also, in the
                      instance
                      of a Root Canal Treatment, a crown needs to be done to protect the tooth.

                      Significantly stronger than normal fillings, Inlays and Onlays, crowns protect teeth that
                      otherwise may eventually break and become untreatable. Crowns cover the entire tooth surface and
                      are made of Full Porcelain, Zirconia or Porcelain over Metal. With advances in materials and
                      techniques, crowns can give you the strength, beauty and translucency of a natural tooth.

                      A wisdom tooth is also known as the third molar. In general, wisdom teeth will grow out of the
                      gums between the ages of 18 to 21. If the wisdom tooth erupts straight out, they do not need to be
                      removed. However, these wisdom teeth does not always grow out as desired.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      When they do not erupt properly, wisdom teeth can cause pain and infection. This is when the
                      removal of these wisdom teeth becomes necessary. The procedure can be performed by specialists to
                      ensure that the removal is safe and painless.

                      A wisdom tooth surgery is a procedure whereby the dentist performs a minor but delicate surgical
                      procedure to safely remove a wisdom tooth that has not erupted as desired.

                      Wisdom tooth surgeries are usually done under local anaesthesia. However, there is a small
                      percentage of patients who are sensitive to pain and are anxious about the procedure, these
                      patients have the option of having the removal done under intra-venous sedation. The intra-venous
                      sedation, is done by a qualified specialist to help patients sleep comfortably throughout the
                      procedure.

                      Research has shown that wisdom tooth surgery is a very safe and straight-forward procedure. With
                      proper examination and x-rays analysis, dentists will be able to predictably and safely perform
                      wisdom tooth surgical procedures. The x-rays helps the dentist to plan for a successful surgery
                      and to note on details like the positioning of your wisdom tooth and how close the root is growing
                      to the nerve that runs in the lower jaw. This is important as the compression of the nerve will
                      cause the patient to experience some numbness to the lower lip.

                      painkillers and other medication will be prescribed to aid with pain management and healing.

                            <span class="text font-weight-bold">1. Saving of teeth</span> <br>
                            When wisdom teeth do not grow out straight, food trap will occur between the wisdom tooth
                            and its adjacent tooth. The food trapped results in decay and gum disease which affect the
                            wisdom teeth and its neighbouring teeth. <br>

                            Early removal of the wisdom tooth can prevent the loss of your initial molars. <br>
                            <span class="text font-weight-bold">2. Prevention of pain and swelling</span> <br>

                            Food trap between the wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth can lead to infection. With
                            infection, patients often experience severe pain and swelling. More serious problems such as
                            the formulation of cysts or tumours around an impacted tooth can occur. This leads to the
                            destruction of the surrounding jawbone, tissues and neighbouring teeth, leading to
                            prolonged, costly treatments. If such serious conditions are not addressed, the infection
                            could eventually become so severe that it becomes life threatening. <br>
                            <span class="text font-weight-bold">3. Elimination of bad breath</span> <br>

                            Patients often complain of bad breath due to the build-up of food and bacteria between
                            wisdom tooth and its adjacent tooth or under the gums covering the wisdom tooth. Sometimes,
                            people surrounding the patient can detect the rancid smell that emits from the patent’s
                            mouth. When this occurs, the removal of the wisdom tooth causing the odour should do the
                            job. <br>
                            <span class="text font-weight-bold">4. Prevention of cyst formation</span> <br>

                            Wisdom teeth that failed to grow out can lead to formation of cyst. In rare but serious
                            development, these cysts can become cancerous. Hence, removal of wisdom tooth is indicated
                            for these reasons.

                            Wisdom tooth surgery is pain-free. Local anaesthesia is given prior to the surgical
                            procedure. <br>

                            For patients who are anxious, wisdom tooth surgery can be done under intra-venous sedation
                            (IV sedation). The sedation which is done by a specialist helps the patient to sleep
                            comfortably throughout the procedure. <br>

                            <span class="text font-weight-bold">2. How long is wisdom tooth surgery?</span> <br>

                            Most wisdom tooth surgery can be completed in 30 to 45 minutes. <br>

                            Most of the time is used to prepare the patient; such as ensuring that the patient has
                            pain-free injections and is relaxed before the surgery. <br>

                            Depending on your oral condition and the number of wisdom teeth you will be extracting, your
                            dentist will be able to advise you on the duration only after a thorough initial
                            examination. <br>

                            In general, patients will be able to eat normally after 1-2 days. <br>

                            Patients might experience mild pain for the first day but it can be easily and effectively
                            controlled with painkillers. <br>

                            Bleeding usually stops after one day. <br>

                      In the blossoming world of cosmetic dentistry, teeth whitening reigns supreme. Universally valued
                      by men and women alike, whitening (or bleaching) treatments are available to satisfy every budget,

                      According to the FDA, the term “bleaching” is permitted to be used only when the teeth can be
                      whitened beyond their natural color. Teeth bleaching uses a strong oxidizing agent to lighten the
                      teeth such as hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. It can be done at a dental clinic with a
                      more concentrated solution and special bleaching light or laser, or at home using a customized
                      tray with a less concentrated bleaching gel.

                              lower than what your dentist would use in the office. If you are thinking about using an
                              over-the-counter bleaching kit, discuss options with your dentist and look for one with
                              the ADA Seal of Acceptance. That means it has been tested to be safe and effective for

                      Tartar/plaque removal is important to keep your teeth healthy and look good. However, not everyone
                      recognizes it's importance. The article below will help you understand why you should remove

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Food debris on the teeth surface will form hard plaques on the neck and crown. This is the main
                      cause of dental diseases such as bad breath, tooth root bleeding, gingival recession, swollen
                      gums, loosened teeth, etc. These diseases if not treated in time will easily lead to teeth loss.
                      <br>
                      Normally, these "stubborn" plaques cannot be removed by themselves but have to be removed with
                      specialized tools at the dentist. Dental professionals also recommend that everyone should have
                      tartar removal treatment every 6 months to prevent dental disease and maintain oral health.

                      When you notice that your teeth have the following signs, you should quickly perform tartar

                      - Too much plaque causes aesthetic problems. <br>
                      - Plaque can cause unpleasant odors, which interfere with daily communication. <br>
                      - Irritation of the gums which can lead to dental diseases such as periodontitis, gingivitis, etc.

                      Gum disease is one of the two most common diseases that affect our oral cavity. This disease
                      affects the gum and bone surrounding the teeth. The disease does not produce obvious signs and
                      symptoms until it has progressed to an advanced stage. In all stages of gum disease, patients
                      usually suffer from bleeding gums as a result of bacteria causing damage to the gums.
                      <br>
                      Gum specialists (Periodontists) are specially trained dentists who detect and treat the complete
                      range of gum diseases.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="heading text-center font-weight-bold">What is Gum Disease?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      In order to understand gum disease, we need to first understand the structures surrounding the
                      tooth. The tooth is divided into the crown and the root. The root is surrounded by bone, which in
                      turn is covered by gums. There is a space between the tooth and gums, called a pocket, which is
                      present both in healthy and diseased states.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Gum disease originates from bacteria that gain entry into the pocket. When bacteria enter, they
                      attack the gums. This causes injury to the gums, resulting in spontaneous bleeding upon touch,
                      pain, redness, and sometimes swelling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      The accumulated bacteria in the infected gums can enter our blood stream to be transported to the
                      various organs; such as the heart, kidneys, and womb; in the body. The maintenance of good oral
                      health is paramount in controlling a series of health problems that will occur with gum disease,
                      but having said that, it becomes a vicious cycle as it is also established by the World Health
                      Organisation (WHO) that patients afflicted with conditions such as diabetes are prone to the
                      worsening of gum disease.

                              The inevitable outcome of uncontrolled gum disease is tooth loss. Many of these teeth loss
                              are not decayed nor fractured. They are either extracted because they are too loose and
                              cause pain when eating or they can even drop out on their own. Gum treatment will save
                              many of these teeth.

                              Bleeding from the gums is one of the first few signs of gum disease. Many patients can
                              experience bleeding upon brushing or eating. In severe cases, bleeding can occur
                              spontaneously.

                              Due to the build-up of food and bacteria under the gums, patients with gum disease often
                              complain of bad breath. Sometimes, people surrounding the patients can detect the smell
                              emitting from the patient’s mouth as well. Successful treatment of gum disease can
                              eliminate the problem of bad breath.

                              Untreated gum disease can cause bacteria to enter our blood stream and affect our health.
                              Research have shown that patients with gum disease have an increased risk of heart

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Dental braces are orthodontic appliances designed to straighten and improve the aesthetics and
                      function of your teeth. This benefits both adults and children as straight teeth are easier to
                      clean. In addition, after the teeth have been straightened, there is usually an increase in
                      overall self-esteem and confidence level.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      The braces process can be uncomfortable when the teeth are being moved. Braces can also trap more
                      food than usual, so great attention to good oral hygiene is required to prevent tooth decay and
                      gum disease. The common types of braces include the traditional metal braces, ceramic braces,
                      self-ligating braces and lingual braces. For aesthetics reasons, there are also invisible or clear
                      braces (a more commonly known brand is Invisalign) options, you can read more about Invisalign
                      here.

                      Root canal treatment is a procedure, which eliminates infection that has reached the nerves of the
                      affected tooth. <br>

                      Signs of infection requiring root canal treatment include pain, prolonged sensitivity to hot or
                      cold, tenderness to chewing, swelling of the gum and the discolouration of the tooth. <br>

                      During root canal treatment, the infected nerves are removed and the inside of the tooth is
                      disinfected and cleaned. It is then filled and sealed with a rubber-like material called
                      gutta-percha.<br>

                      The tooth is then restored with a crown or permanent filling for protection. After the final
                      restorations, the tooth continues to function like any other tooth.

                              3. An opening is made in the crown of the tooth and small instruments are used to clean out

                              4. The prepared root canal is filled with a biocompatible material and sealed to prevent
                              bacteria from re-entering the canal.
