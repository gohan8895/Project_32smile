            <b>1. Introduction</b> <br>
            The emergence of new genomic technologies, including next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics, has
            greatly increased our knowledge and understanding of the oral microbiome and its importance in health. The
            oral microbiota in health is very diverse and more than 700 different bacterial species have been identified
            in the oral cavity [1,2]. In each healthy individual, the number of resident species is estimated to be
            fewer, that is in the range of 250–300 different species, of which the genus Streptococcus being the most
            abundant [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. The oral cavity offers a moist and warm environment with host-derived
            nutrients, such as dietary sugar, salivary proteins, glycoproteins and gingival crevicular fluid, which
            makes it a suitable residence for the growth of many different microorganisms, mostly bacteria but also
            fungi, viruses, archaea and protozoa [2,8,9]. The oral cavity offers several different niches for microbial
            colonisation such as teeth, gingival sulcus, attached gingiva, tongue, cheek, lip, and hard and soft palate
            that display a site specific microbiota [3,10]. Moreover, the teeth are the only natural non-shedding
            surfaces in the human body, and thereby provide opportunities for extensive biofilm formation and microbial
            residence [2,11]. Similarly, dental restorations, fillings, fixed prosthodontics, dentures and implants
            display non-shedding surfaces that can influence biofilm formation and the composition of the resident oral
            microbiota [[12], [13], [14]]. <br>

            The complex and diverse oral microbial ecosystem plays an important role in the promotion and maintenance of
            oral health. Several factors influence the formation and maintenance of the oral microbiota including the
            host (behaviour and defence mechanisms), the local environment and the microorganisms themselves, that is,
            their ability to adhere, co-aggregate, interact with other species as well as their virulence [2,[15], [16],
            [17]]. One of the factors that plays a very significant role in the oral homeostasis and symbiosis is saliva
            [16,[18], [19], [20]].
            <br>
            Saliva contributes to the formation of the acquired enamel pellicle and mucosal pellicle, which covers the
            oral hard and soft tissues, respectively, and thereby helps to modulate the initial adhesion and
            colonisation of microorganisms and shape the composition of the resident oral microbiota [4,[21], [22],
            [23], [24], [25]]. Furthermore, saliva facilitates clearance of microorganisms and dietary carbohydrates
            from the oral cavity, but it also supplies colonising bacteria with nutrients through breakdown of dietary
            starch, lipids and proteins and bacterial metabolism of salivary components, e.g. glycoproteins [20,25,27].
            In addition, salivary mucins have the capacity to bind and aggregate microorganisms whereby their adherence
            and colonisation are inhibited. Saliva also provides antimicrobial activity through numerous proteins and
            peptides including mucins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, statherin, histatins and antibodies
            (secretory immunoglobin A, sIgA) [2,[17], [18], [19], [20],25,26]. Moreover, saliva facilitates mastication,
            swallowing and speech, and takes part in initial digestion [26]. The objective of this review article is to
            give an update on our current understanding of how saliva and its various constituents directly and
            indirectly affect oral bacteria and thereby play a role in the modulation and maintenance of a healthy oral
            microbiota and also the associations with symbiosis and dysbiosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Saliva secretion and composition</b> <br>
            Whole saliva is a complex mixture of fluids produced by three paired major salivary glands, i.e. the
            parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands, and numerous minor salivary glands located in the oral mucosa
            [28]. In addition, whole saliva contains components of non-glandular origin, such as desquamated oral
            epithelial cells, food debris, microorganisms, gingival crevicular fluid and blood-derived compounds (plasma
            proteins, erythrocytes and leucocytes). The levels in saliva of the two latter are dependent on the degree
            of periodontal and oral mucosal inflammation [27,29,30].
            <br>
            About 90% of the total amount of saliva is produced by the major salivary glands and the remaining 10% by
            the minor salivary glands. However, the minor salivary glands play an important role in lubrication of the
            oral mucosa and also account for a large fraction of the secretion of salivary proteins [28]. The flow rate
            and the composition of saliva is dependent on various factors including the type and the size of gland which
            is activated [31], the time of day [32], state of hydration [33], nutritional state [34], the physical and
            chemical nature and duration of stimulus applied to activate the secretory reflexes [35], the emotional
            state of the individual [36] and gender [37]. Upon stimulation, the parotid gland (a purely serous gland)
            produces watery, amylase-rich saliva, whereas the submandibular (mainly serous), sublingual (mainly mucous)
            and the minor salivary glands (mainly mucous, except from the von Ebners’ glands which are strictly serous)
            produce more viscous, slimy mucin-rich saliva [[26], [27], [28]].
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3. Saliva flow and composition</b> <br>
            Whole saliva, which constantly covers the hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity, is a complex, hypotonic
            and slightly acidic fluid [[26], [27], [28],38]. In healthy persons, the total volume of saliva secreted per
            day is 0.5–1.0 litre, with an average of 0.6 L [39]. Saliva consists of more than 99% water and less than 1%
            solids such as proteins and electrolytes [[26], [27], [28],38]. Under normal conditions, the mean
            unstimulated whole salivary flow rate is in the range of 0.3–0.4 ml/min. An unstimulated whole salivary flow
            rate of 0.1 ml is considered pathologically low and designated hyposalivation. The mean chewing-stimulated
            whole salivary flow rates range from 1.5 to 2.0 ml and flow rates below 0.5–0.7 ml are considered abnormal
            (hyposalivation) [37,40,41].
            <br>
            A normal flow of unstimulated and stimulated saliva is important to ensure sufficient and continuous
            lubrication of the teeth and oral mucous membranes, and also helps to prevent retrograde infection of the
            salivary glands with oral microorganisms via the salivary ducts [19,26,27,42]. Moreover, the fluid
            characteristics of saliva are essential for the mechanical rinsing of the oral cavity, for dissolving taste
            substances and transporting them to taste receptor sites, protection of the taste buds, food bolus
            formation, clearance of food debris and microorganisms, and facilitation of mastication and swallowing as
            well as speech. The moist environment is also important for the colonisation and growth of microorganisms on
            oral surfaces, which is addressed further below.
            <br>
            <b>3.1. Salivary clearance</b>
            <br>
            The process by which saliva dilutes and eliminates food substances such as sugars and acids from the oral
            cavity is referred to as salivary or oral clearance [[43], [44], [45], [46]]. Before swallowing, the volume
            of saliva present in the oral cavity is on average 1.1 ml, and after a swallow, the residual volume of
            saliva is approximately 0.8 ml. This volume of saliva is spread out in a thin film, on average 0.1 mm thick.
            However, the thickness of the salivary film varies greatly between different parts of the oral cavity [44].
            The clearance rate is determined by the salivary flow rate, the volumes of saliva in the mouth before and
            after swallowing and the swallowing frequency. It has been shown that low residual volume of saliva and high
            unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates facilitate the rate of clearance of fermentable
            carbohydrates and acids from food and drinks [43]. Saliva also plays an important role in clearance of
            desquamated epithelial cells from the oral cavity each of which carry about 100 microorganisms and for
            elimination of the microorganisms present in saliva [47]. One millilitre of human saliva from a healthy
            individual contains about 100 million bacterial cells. With a normal salivary secretion of 750 ml per day,
            about 8 × 1010 bacteria are shed from the oral mucosal surfaces per day, equivalent to 5–10 g of wet weight
            of bacterial cells [48]. Thus, saliva flow and subsequent swallowing promote removal of a significant number
            of bacteria and thereby play an important role in balancing the oral microbiome.
            <br>
            In patients with severe and persistent reduction in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rates due
            to e.g. medication-intake, radiation damage to the salivary glands or Sjögren’s syndrome, the retention of
            food substances and microorganisms in the oral cavity is prolonged [49]. The consequence hereof is a shift
            in the oral microbiota favouring the growth of more aciduric and acid-tolerating bacteria, especially
            Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacilli, which through fermentation of carbohydrates
            produce acids that increase the risk for dental caries [2,15,16,18,19,26,50]. It has been shown that the
            oral sugar clearance is markedly lower in patients with unstimulated whole saliva flow rates below 0.16 ml
            which increases the risk of tooth demineralisation [51]. Moreover, during caries development the
            caries-associated species increase in numbers and the colonisation and growth of more beneficial species is
            inhibited [52]. A further consequence of reduced saliva flow is the increased number of Candida albicans
            which often leads to manifest oral candidiasis [50].
            <br>
            <b>3.2. Inorganic salivary components</b>
            <br>
            The inorganic salivary constituents include sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate and
            bicarbonate as well as trace elements. The composition of saliva, especially the concentration of various
            ions, is dependent on the flow rate [53]. Thus the concentrations of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, total
            protein and total calcium are higher and the concentrations of potassium and total phosphate are lower in
            stimulated saliva compared to unstimulated saliva [[26], [27], [28],38]. The physico-chemical properties of
            the inorganic salivary components and thereby their role in formation of oral surface biofilms and hence on
            the resident oral microbiota are addressed below.
            <br>
            <b>3.3. Salivary pH and salivary buffer capacity</b> <br>
            The salivary buffer capacity includes the bicarbonate, phosphate and protein systems [[54], [55], [56],
            [57]]. The role of salivary buffer systems is to maintain the salivary pH at a relatively constant level
            (i.e. 6.5–7) by buffering acids from dietary intake and acids produced by bacterial fermentation of
            carbohydrates, thereby decreasing the tooth demineralisation rate [26,27,56]. The concentration of
            bicarbonate in saliva and the salivary pH are highly dependent on the salivary flow rate, and the pH can,
            under normal physiological conditions, vary from 6.0 to 7.5. The bicarbonate concentration and thus the pH
            increase when the salivary flow rate increases and vice versa. The concentration of bicarbonate is highest
            in parotid saliva and lowest in the minor salivary glands [28,56]. There are even findings indicating that
            the labial salivary glands do not secrete bicarbonate upon stimulation [58].
            <br>
            The clearance rate of acids produced by oral bacteria varies between different oral sites, creating local
            micro-environmental conditions, i.e. niches with low pH. This can explain some of the site-specific
            differences in bacterial composition seen in the oral cavity [[59], [60], [61]].
            <br>
            Salivary pH and the levels of calcium and phosphate are important factors for the maintenance of saturation
            with regard to hydroxyapatite in the saliva. In addition, saliva contains proteins including acidic
            proline-rich proteins, histatins, cystatins and statherins, which display high affinity to hydroxyapatite as
            they bind calcium ions, and also inhibit precipitation of calcium phosphate salts from saliva supersaturated
            with respect to hydroxyapatite and thereby play a central role in the integrity of the teeth [62]. The ions
            in saliva, including calcium, are also important to the function of α-amylase in the oral cavity [63].
            <br>
            In addition to being part of the buffer capacity, contributing to keep the oral environment supersaturated
            with respect to calcium phosphates, phosphate is also a nutrient for the oral microbiota. Moreover, bacteria
            help to buffer saliva by breaking down urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide resulting in an increase in pH
            [64].
            <br>
            The salivary buffer capacity, and its ability to keep the pH within a neutral range, is important for the
            promotion and maintenance of the healthy microbial composition and consequently for symbiosis [16,65].
            Consequently, salivary gland hypofunction is associated with changes in the composition of saliva, an
            impaired salivary buffer capacity and low pH conditions in the oral environment, resulting in a shift in the
            homeostasis of the healthy oral microbiota leading to dysbiosis and oral diseases [2,13,15,16]. Furthermore,
            before awareness of risk of oral diseases, patients with salivary gland hypofunction may have a frequent
            intake of fermentable carbohydrates like soft drinks and candy in order to alleviate the symptoms of oral
            dryness [56,66] which additional favour the growth of S. mutans and Lactobacillus and Candida species.
            <br>
            <b>3.4. The salivary pellicle</b>
            <br>
            The thin acellular film that forms on tooth surfaces upon exposure to the oral environment, is designated
            the acquired enamel pellicle. It mainly comprises adsorbed salivary proteins, but also non-salivary-derived
            carbohydrates, proteins and lipids [21,22]. The enamel pellicle is important for the maintenance of dental
            health due to its role in lubrication, mineral homeostasis of the tooth surfaces and in determining the
            composition of the initial colonising microorganisms which form the initial layer of dental plaque on the
            tooth surfaces [2,21,22,67]. Together with salivary ions, several salivary proteins such as proline-rich
            proteins, cystatins, mucins, lactoferrin, lysozyme and α-amylase and secretory IgA take part in the
            formation of the acquired enamel pellicle and interact with several oral bacteria on adsorption to
            hydroxyapatite [[67], [68], [69], [70]].
            <br>
            The oral mucosa is also covered by a thin salivary pellicle comprising different salivary proteins,
            especially mucins [[71], [72], [73], [74]]. The mucosal pellicle includes secreted soluble mucins (MUC5B and
            MUC7), membrane-associated epithelial mucins (MUC1), and to a lesser extent carbonic anhydrase IV, secretory
            IgA, cystatins and α-amylase [74]. Recent findings indicate that the fine structure of the mucosal pellicle
            differs from the enamel pellicle and due to its composition of larger glycoproteins retaining water, it can
            be considered as a hydrogel, with a lower tenacity than the enamel pellicle [74]. Maturation and turnover
            are influenced by the presence and variety of salivary proteins, by the salivary flow and the desquamating
            oral epithelium. Similar to the dental pellicle, the mucosal pellicle provides lubrication and a protective
            barrier against exogenous potential damaging substances and microorganisms [71,72]. About 80% of the oral
            cavity consists of oral mucosal surfaces, and thus exhibits an extensive area for bacterial attachment [75].
            <br>
            The microorganisms that colonise the oral cavity have developed various ways to bind to the salivary film on
            the oral mucosa and teeth [75]. Accordingly, several families of gram-positive bacteria produce surface
            proteins, including serine-rich repeat, antigen I/II, and pilus families that mediate adherence to a variety
            of salivary and oral bacterial receptors [75]. The serine-rich repeat bacterial surface adhesions, which are
            able to recognise carbohydrate (saccharide) moieties of glycosylated salivary components, are produced by
            streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli [76].
            <br>
            Families of gram-negative bacteria may exhibit pili, auto-transporters, and extracellular matrix-binding,
            which are important for host tissue recognition and formation of complex microbial communities. Fibrillar
            proteins are important mediators of the initial attachment of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas
            gingivalis to gingival epithelial cells through recognition of αvβ3 and α5β1 integrin receptors on the
            epithelial cell surface [77].
            <br>
            After initial attachment of microbial cells, an extracellular matrix is formed, supporting biofilm
            development, promoting microbial adhesion to surfaces and cohesion and influencing diffusion [78,79]. This
            matrix consists of a large number of hydrated extracellular polymeric substances including
            exopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and lipo-oligosaccharides that are important for the
            growth and survival of microbial species [78]. Polysaccharides (glycans) produced by exoenzymes,
            glucosyltransferases, from S. mutans are the main components of the matrix of cariogenic plaque-biofilms and
            are also considered a virulence determinant of dental caries [79]. In cases where dietary sucrose is
            available in excess, glucosyltransferase activity is closely related to caries development. Some of the
            streptococcal exoenzymes have the ability to bind with the salivary pellicle, α-amylase and to the surfaces
            of streptococci and of other bacterial species [79].
            <br>
            The initial attachment of primary colonizers to oral surfaces presents new receptors for the subsequent
            adhesion of other bacteria. The binding of bacterial cells to pre-adherent cells on a surface is thought to
            be important for the recruitment of secondary colonizers to the oral biofilm.
            <br>
            Overall, the molecular composition and the physical and chemical properties of the salivary pellicle are
            important for the initial colonisation of microorganisms onto the oral surfaces. It is also important for
            the subsequent adhesion of other microorganisms, the interaction between species, including co-aggregation
            and co-adhesion that among others enables C. albicans to colonise surfaces already coated with streptococci
            [80].
            <br>
            <b>3.5. Salivary organic components</b> <br>
            Analysis of the human salivary proteome has characterised about 3000 different proteins and peptides [81].
            More than 90% in weight of the about 3000 protein components are present in saliva from the parotid,
            submandibular and sublingual glands, belonging to the classes of acidic and basic proline-rich proteins,
            α-amylases, mucins, cystatins, histatins, statherin and host defence peptides and accounting for about 200
            proteins and peptides. The remaining 10% in weight are components deriving from the minor glands (labial,
            palatine, buccal and lingual glands) [82], and from gingival crevicular fluid, e.g. α-defensins, and
            products of mucosal exudates. Many of these proteins and peptides have antibacterial, antifungal and
            antiviral properties, others lubricate oral tissues, some help to maintain high salivary concentrations of
            calcium, some are digestive enzymes, and some catalyse the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbonic acids,
            and most of them act in concert and display multifunctionality [[18], [19], [20],26,27]. The components of
            saliva with indirect and direct antimicrobial properties are listed in Table 1.
