          <h2 class="mb-3">Urgent Care Dentistry and the Future</h2>
          <p>
            A number of factors have come together that very well may influence urgent/emergency care dentistry being
            combined within the emerging dental specialty of general dentistry. The ADA does not follow the medical
            model of specialty recognition. The medical model does not require an emerging specialty to be completely
            unique as compared to other existing specialties but does require that, after completing approved clinical
            training, doctors demonstrate a minimum level of competence by successfully completing diplomat
            examinations. Examples include the medical specialties of internal medicine, family medicine, and urgent
            care medicine. The American Board of Dental Specialties (ABDS) was formed in 2014. The ABDS follows the
            medical model, and many state constitutions also follow the medical model with respect to healthcare
            specialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, Rasubala and Ren2 reported on the necessity of competency-based dental education with respect to
            urgent dental care. They reported that careful evaluation of dental school curricula revealed significant
            deficiencies in regard to the diagnosis and management of urgent dental care. They related the importance of
            dental education in training clinicians within the art and science of emergent dental care, as dental pain
            is found to be the most prevalent category of bodily pain and affects 12% to 15% of the worldwide
            population. In countries without universal healthcare, competency-based education in urgent care dentistry
            becomes particularly important.

            <b>The Importance of Urgent Dental Care Clinics in Our Dental Schools</b> <br>
            A dental school emergency dentistry clinic provides a real-life teaching environment. It provides dental
            students and residents with patient care on many levels, including diagnosis and therapeutic interventions
            with respect to acute dental pain and periodontal and periapical infections, which may involve such
            disciplines as restorative, prosthetic, periodontal, endodontic, clinical oral pathological,
            pharmacological, and acute and chronic orofacial pain management.2-6 The broadness of possible urgent dental
            care concerns supports that urgent dental care should be incorporated within general dentistry. A survey of
            US dental school emergency dental clinics by Tiwana et al6 found that more than 65% of the responding
            institutions reported that they did not overtly evaluate student performance for urgent care rotations.
            However, it is agreed that dental school emergency dental clinics provide an invaluable teaching
            environment, particularly with respect to oral diagnoses. A situation where patients present with real-life
            oral and dental pain complaints is an excellent environment to enhance diagnostic skills. Students are
            presented with real-life diagnostic dilemmas, which demand a global triage concept of evaluating patient
            complaints, medical histories, and clinical findings as well as real-time sets of solutions.2,6 Furthermore,
            dental school emergency dental clinics serve as safety nets for the indigent and patients who are unable to
            receive therapeutic resolutions from private dental facilities.7-10 Incorporating urgent dental care within
            advanced general dentistry and/or general practice residency curricula should enhance the abilities of
            general dentists with respect to the clinical care of patients with dental emergencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Weaknesses in the Present Hospital ER System</b> <br>
            There are very few hospital emergency room services presently able to effectively and adequately provide
            comprehensive dental emergency services. Some may have oral and maxillofacial surgery residents on call, but
            many hospitals have limited, if any, clinical dentists available for urgent oral care needs. Urgent care
            physicians have very little training with respect to evaluating and treating urgent dental care needs. Other
            than analgesic and antibiotic prescription writing and incision and drainage procedures, physicians
            typically have very little to offer patients with urgent oral/dental care issues.2-4 Kelekar and Naavaal9
            reported that urgent dental care performed within hospital emergency rooms is not only unsatisfactory but
            also costly, with an average cost-per-patient-visit of more than $900. Worldwide and within the United
            States, there is a relatively large population that is underserved (cultural, racial, and elderly) with
            respect to dental service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> After-hours Emergency Care</b> <br>
            As there are real problems with regard to after-hours emergencies for dentists (such as the potential issues
            of treating a patient alone, in which a dentist could be robbed or accused of sexual misconduct), hospital
            emergency rooms serve as a last-ditch resource for referring patients during off-hours.11 It is our opinion
            that establishing a dental specialty of urgent care dentistry or a dental specialty of general and urgent
            care dentistry would serve as a benefit to both patients and dentistry. We engaged in an Internet search of
            emergency dental services, which revealed the emergency services advertised in all 50 states and the
            District of Columbia. Corporate websites often advertise the contact information of dentists in local
            communities who choose to highlight emergency dental care among the list of services they offer. The most
            common corporate website advertising emergency dental services is emergencydentistsusa.com, which lists
            dentists in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and appears in Google search results for “emergency
            dentist in [state].” Similarly, the corporate dental chain Aspen Dental also advertises emergency dental
            services for its franchises across the United States. <br>

            A Google search query was initiated for emergency dentists in populous US metropolitan areas. The search was
            confined to cities and metropolitan areas located entirely within a single state so as to not obscure search
            result findings with results visible across state lines. According to the 2017 census estimate,12 the top 5
            metropolitan areas in the United States that satisfied the inclusion criteria of location entirely within a
            single state were Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta. For each metropolitan area, a Google
            search was performed as “emergency dentist in [metropolitan area].” The top 5 websites in each search query
            were selected with the following exclusions: that they were not corporate entities and did not appear as
            paid Google advertisements. These searches were performed in June 2018. <br>

            Out of the 25 websites studied, one website belonged to an oral and maxillofacial surgery practice, and the
            remaining websites belonged to general dentists. Of the 24 websites of general dentists, 2 also advertised
            pediatric dentistry services. At least 4 websites out of the sample of 25 prominently advertised cosmetic
            dentistry services. The most common dental complaint for which emergency services were advertised on almost
            every website was “toothache.” Other dental complaints for which emergent care was advertised included tooth
            injuries, injury to dental restorations and prostheses, jaw trauma, infection, bleeding, tooth avulsion,
            mobility, and gingival swelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Is Emergency Care Accurately Advertised?</b> <br>
            Although advertised as emergency dentists, not every dental practice offered extended care after regular
            business hours or weekends. More than half (14 out of 25) of the websites in this sample did not offer
            services in the evening or during weekend hours. The term “emergency” on these websites appeared to be
            applicable for same-day or walk-in services of acute dental problems. In this sample, 12 dental practices
            offered emergency care or emergency phone consultations after regular business hours on weekdays and
            weekends. Interestingly, all websites in the Los Angeles metro area offered either emergency dental care or
            emergency consultations after regular business hours, but this was not consistent across other metropolitan
            areas. The mention of fees or insurance coverage acceptance for emergency dental care was not routinely made
            on these websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Need for Urgent Care Is Well Established</b> <br>
            There is currently a need for urgent care dental services.2,6,13-16 Tiwana et al6 reported that
            approximately 50% of their emergency dental patients were walk-ins. Diagnosis and treatment are the
            essential mission of educational institutional urgent dental care clinics, and as such, urgent dental care
            clinics fulfill an important role in dental schools’ education and training for students. A well-operated
            urgent care dental clinic breaks down silos by combining such diagnosis and treatment concerns as triage,
            pediatric dentistry, geriatric dentistry, clinical oral pathology/medicine, endodontics, restorative
            dentistry, prosthetic dentistry, temporomandibular disorders, and oral surgery together. They noted that
            more pediatric emergency experiences and more rigorous training would be beneficial for dental student
            education. Incorporating urgent dental care education and clinical training into graduate advanced general
            dentistry or hospital dentistry residency programs would appear to be a reasonable approach. As dental and
            oral emergencies cross all the various silos of existing dental specialties, general dentists are the only
            viable emerging dental specialty to take on the task of establishing advanced education and treatments
            within this area of expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Closing Comments</b> <br>
            The American Board of General Dentistry (ABGD) was merged with the Federal Services Board of Dentistry in
            October 2003. The ABGD was originally incorporated in Illinois in 1984. At present, the emerging dental
            specialty of general dentistry has a history of maintaining 2-year clinical residency programs, regularly
            scheduled diplomat’s credentialing examinations, and a credentialing board. Therefore, it appears that
            general dentists certified by the ABGD will, in the future, have the ability to become recognized by the
            ABDS and by state boards of dental examiners. Incorporating urgent dental care within AGD residency programs
            and within the certification would appear to make ultimate sense in creating a specialty with the potential
            to be recognized by the ADA. <br>

            Within urban and suburban regions, urgent dental care facilities would not be strictly competing with
            existing dental practices but instead offering a niche area of dental services. They would, however, be
            competing with exodontia services and competing price-wise with oral and maxillofacial surgery practices.
            Also, urgent care dental services would offer a referral situation for emergency dental care from general
            dentists and dental specialists. Dentists on vacation, out of town, or on sick leave would be provided with
            a natural alternative for their patients with emergent dental conditions. Patients without an established
            dental care relationship would have a natural pathway for immediate dental care when dental emergencies
            arise.17-20 <br>

            Having a specialty of general and urgent care dentistry would, in our opinion, result in an improvement in
            patient access to care and create an improved economic model for such a dental specialty.
